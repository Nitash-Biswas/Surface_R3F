# Introduction
A Three.js scene in React Three Fiber that allows users to select a surface mesh and grow models on it, such as grass, flowers, or rocks. The scene includes controls for adjusting the density and other properties of the growth.
## Features

### Dropdowns for Surfaces and Models
- Surfaces Dropdown: A dropdown menu named Surfaces that allows the user to select one mesh from a list of predefined meshes.
- Models Dropdown: Another dropdown menu for selecting models to be grown on the selected surface. Examples include grass blades, flower models, and rock models.

### Random Point Sampling
- The code effectively samples random points on the selected mesh surface and instantiate the selected model at those points.
